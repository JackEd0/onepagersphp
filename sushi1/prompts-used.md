## Chat Session Summary - Admin System Creation

### **Project Overview**
Created a complete admin system for a sushi restaurant website (`index.html`) that allows content editing without touching HTML code, similar to a WordPress theme customizer.

### **User Request**
The user wanted to create an `admin.html` page to edit the data of `index.html`. They requested:
- Keep navigation sections (hero, gallery, etc.) in `index.html`
- Add their values to a `site-config.json` file
- Create an admin interface to read and edit the JSON
- Use a PHP file (`save-config.php`) called with AJAX to save changes
- Add selectors to `index.html` to facilitate the JSON configuration

### **Files Created/Modified**

#### **1. site-config.json** (New)
- Created comprehensive JSON structure containing all website content
- Organized into sections: site, navigation, hero, gallery, testimonials, contact, footer
- Includes menu items, customer reviews, contact information, and site settings

#### **2. index.html** (Modified)
- Added `data-config-selector` attributes throughout the HTML
- Implemented JavaScript to load and apply configuration from JSON
